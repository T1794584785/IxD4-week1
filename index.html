        Enjoy Classical Music
        Don’t Know Music Theory
        Can’t play music Instrument
        
        Pains
        1: Many classical music titles are too long and hard to remember, like “Serenade for Strings in D Major,” and I struggle to match them to the melodies.
        2: It’s hard to discover new music—I never know where to start because there are so many pieces out there.
        3: On mainstream streaming platforms, the categorization of classical music is unclear. There are many versions of the same piece, and I don’t know which one is considered “classic.”
        4: My friends don’t like classical music, so there’s no one to discuss it with or recommend pieces to me.
        5: Many promotions for classical music events feel “elitist,” making it hard for me to feel like I belong.
        6: When I hear a melody I like, it’s difficult to find it without lyrics or keywords to search.
        
        Perks
        1: Listening to classical music makes me feel a sense of ritual, like starting my day with Tchaikovsky’s The Seasons.
        2: Sometimes, a melody deeply moves me, giving me a sense of healing and peace.
        3: I enjoy using classical music as background music, for example, when reading or drawing—it helps me focus better.
        4: The experience of attending a live concert is unmatched. Hearing the sound of instruments in person is always thrilling.
        5: I love hearing classical music in movies or TV shows—it often perfectly conveys emotions.
        6: Whenever I get familiar with a new piece, I feel like I’ve “learned” something, like the composer’s style or emotional expression.
        7: Classical music makes me feel connected to a certain culture or history from the past, which is meaningful to me.
        
        Behaviors
        1: Listening to light violin or piano pieces on my headphones during my morning commute to set a positive tone for the day.
        2: Playing soothing classical music (like Debussy’s Clair de Lune) before going to sleep at night.
        3: Following classical music influencers on social media to get recommendations.
        4: Occasionally attending concerts or chamber music performances, especially when there are discounted tickets.
        5: Watching classic performances on YouTube, like Karajan’s recordings of Beethoven symphonies.
        
        Contexts
        1: Playing music through a Bluetooth speaker at home when I’m alone, sometimes with candles or incense for the ambiance.
        2: Randomly shuffling classical playlists on my phone during my commute on the subway or bus.
        3: Listening to Baroque music with headphones in a café or bookstore to block out noise while working.
        4: Dedicating an afternoon on weekends or holidays to listening to a complete symphony, like Mahler’s.
        
        Apps and UsageSpotify / Apple Music:
        I use these streaming platforms to listen to classical playlists like “Classical Essentials” or “Baroque Chill.”
        The last time I used Spotify was this morning to listen to light piano music to start my day.
        Shazam:
        Occasionally, I use it to identify classical music I hear in videos or on the radio.
        A few days ago, I used it to identify Debussy’s Minuet in a short video.
